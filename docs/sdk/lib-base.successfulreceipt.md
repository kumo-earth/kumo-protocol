## SuccessfulReceipt type

Indicates that the transaction has succeeded.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type SuccessfulReceipt<R = unknown, D = unknown> = {
    status: "succeeded";
    rawReceipt: R;
    details: D;
};
```

## Remarks

The `rawReceipt` property is an implementation-specific transaction receipt object.

The `details` property may contain more information about the transaction. See the return types of [TransactableKumo](./lib-base.transactablekumo.md) functions for the exact contents of `details` for each type of Kumo transaction.
